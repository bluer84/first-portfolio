# first-portfolio
my first web repo on github.
this is the repository I created when learning how to code in the girls who code summer bootcamp. I learned things such as:
wireframes for websites- creating a basic idea/outline for your website on paper.
translating that wireframe into a more precise web design using figma, as well as how to use the website's tools and functions.
coding that design into an actual website which is what we're learning today.
html (hypertext markup language- i didn't know that's what it stood for lol) which is used to make the structure and contents of web documents using tags and attributes, embedding images and creating links, and making the website interactable.
css (cascading style sheets- i didn't even know what this was) used to customize the websites fonts, colors, shapes and overrall make the html unique and custom.
bootstrap, figma, github, etc... websites are valuable tools for now and the future <3 I especially love figma for its creative design tools. 
here I also learned how to create a meaningful and proffesional website, contributing to job exposure with a portfolio and overall the basics of web design. (a usful tool for any field, not just computer engineering)
6 steps of web development cycle: 1- planning, 2- design, 3- developing 4- testing 5- launching 6 - support
